;;; deymstifycpp.el --- C++ Macro Expander for Emacs  
;; 
;; Demystifycpp resurrects functionality that used to work out of the box for 
;; Emacs C mode: preprocssor macro expansion. 
;;
;; The problem of macro expansion has resurfaced in modern C++ due to limitations
;; with  meta-programming in C++. Although frowned uopon in general use because of
;; issues inherent to macro hygene and type safety, pre-processor macros
;; are seeing a resurgance in their popularity in C++ meta programming where 
;; they are used to compensate for the inherent limitations of template parameterization 
;; (STL) as a meta programming tool. Pre-processor macros allow arbitraty textual
;; transformations, hence may be used, in a very limited way, to similar effect as Lisp macros.
;;
;; A classic example are the many macros in BOOST, for example BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE
;;
;; Pre-processor expansion is provided natively by C++ compilers, yet the listing of header
;; #includes usually yields multiple thousands of lines of output for even
;; the tiniest C++ code examples, which makes sensible code navigation nearly impossible.
;; Demystifycpp solves this by truncating includes and presenting a read only buffer
;; with all macros expanded directly in the editor.
